/*
1.)	Create a Process as an object in your language of choice.  The process must have the following:
a.	An array (for instructions), 
b.	int (as our counter), 
c.	mutable string (as our state), 
d.	int (for the process ID)
e.	int (number of Threads)
2.)	Create a Thread as an object.  The thread must have the following:
a.	An Array (for instruction)
b.	Int (as our thread #)
c.	Mutable string (as our state)
d.	Int (for the Process ID it links to)
3.)	Create a method that randomly creates processes and then creates threads inside of those processes.
4.)	Print to the screen the IDs of the processes it created and then randomly terminate processes.
5.)	Have your program run for 10 minutes â€“ randomly creating and terminating processes.
